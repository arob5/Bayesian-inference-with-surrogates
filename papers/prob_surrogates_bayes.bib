This paper focuses on methods where the selection of points is essentially deterministic, with an emphasis on achieving accurate approximation when $n$ is small. To this end, we present Stein Points. The idea is to exploit either a greedy or a conditional gradient method to iteratively minimise a kernel Stein discrepancy between the empirical measure and $p(x)$. Our empirical results demonstrate that Stein Points enable accurate approximation of the posterior at modest computational cost. In addition, theoretical results are provided to establish convergence of the method.}

abstract = {Bayesian quadrature treats the problem of numerical integration as one of statistical inference. A prior Gaussian process distribution is assumed for the integrand, observations arise from evaluating the integrand at selected points, and a posterior distribution is derived for the integrand and the integral. Methods are developed for quadrature in Rp. A particular application is integrating the posterior density arising from some other Bayesian analysis. Simulation results are presented, to show that the resulting Bayes–Hermite quadrature rules may perform better than the conventional Gauss–Hermite rules for this application. A key result is derived for product designs, which makes Bayesian quadrature practically useful for integrating in several dimensions. Although the method does not at present provide a solution to the more difficult problem of quadrature in high dimensions, it does seem to offer real improvements over existing methods in relatively low dimensions.}

abstract = {We consider a Bayesian approach to nonlinear inverse problems in which the unknown quantity is a spatial or temporal field, endowed with a hierarchical Gaussian process prior. Computational challenges in this construction arise from the need for repeated evaluations of the forward model (e.g., in the context of Markov chain Monte Carlo) and are compounded by high dimensionality of the posterior. We address these challenges by introducing truncated Karhunen–Loève expansions, based on the prior distribution, to efficiently parameterize the unknown field and to specify a stochastic forward problem whose solution captures that of the deterministic forward model over the support of the prior. We seek a solution of this problem using Galerkin projection on a polynomial chaos basis, and use the solution to construct a reduced-dimensionality surrogate posterior density that is inexpensive to evaluate. We demonstrate the formulation on a transient diffusion equation with prescribed source terms, inferring the spatially-varying diffusivity of the medium from limited and noisy data.}

Evaluation of integrals over the unknown parameter space is recast, more efficiently, as Monte Carlo sampling of the random variables underlying the PC expansion. We evaluate the utility of this technique on a transient diffusion problem arising in contaminant source inversion. The accuracy of posterior estimates is examined with respect to the order of the PC representation, the choice of PC basis, and the decomposition of the support of the prior. The computational cost of the new scheme shows significant gains over direct sampling.}

abstract = {Design optimization or inverse problems, which involve determining input parameters to achieve specific desired outputs, are essential in many engineering applications. Conventional artificial intelligence methods for solving inverse problems rely on single-stage surrogate modeling. However, these methods can be limited in their ability to fully represent the complex relationship between inputs and outputs, hindering a comprehensive exploration of potential solutions and overlooking valid alternatives. To address this challenge, this paper presents a novel two-stage framework that combines two distinct machine learning models: a “learner” and an “evaluator”. The learner identifies a subset of candidate inputs whose predicted outputs closely match the target. The evaluator then refines this selection by further narrowing the input space, resulting in more precise predictions. A key innovation is the incorporation of conformal inference, a statistical technique that quantifies prediction uncertainty in a distribution-free setting and is applicable to any machine learning model. The framework’s effectiveness is validated through extensive benchmark testing using a simulated data set and an engineering case study on artificial microstructure generation of fiber-reinforced composites. The results demonstrate that this two-stage approach significantly outperforms traditional single-stage methods, consistently delivering more accurate and reliable solutions. For instance, the framework consistently identifies input configurations that closely align with two desired descriptors across varying fiber counts, while single surrogate models yield solutions far from the targets without any precautions. This paper is concluded by discussing potential future enhancements, including the integration of deep learning models and strategies for addressing distribution shifts within the framework.}

In the era of Industry 4.0, symbolizing rapid technological advancement through the integration of advanced digital technologies into industrial processes, model calibration plays a key role in advancing digital twin technology, ensuring alignment between digital representations and real-world systems. This comprehensive review focuses on the Kennedy and O'Hagan (KOH) framework (Kennedy and O'Hagan, Journal of the Royal Statistical Society: Series B 2001; 63(3):425–464). In particular, we explore recent advancements addressing the challenges of the unidentifiability issue while accommodating model inadequacy within the KOH framework. In addition, we explore recent advancements in adapting the KOH framework to complex scenarios, including those involving multivariate outputs and functional calibration parameters. We also delve into experimental design strategies tailored to the unique demands of model calibration. By offering a comprehensive analysis of the KOH approach and its diverse applications, this review serves as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners aiming to enhance the accuracy and reliability of their computer models.

The originality of the method lies in an adaptation involving the representation of the likelihood function by a Gaussian process surrogate model, to cope with the high computational cost of the simulation, while avoiding the surrogate modeling of the functional output. The adaptation focuses on taking into account the uncertainty introduced by the use of a surrogate model when estimating the parameters posterior probability distribution by MCMC. To this end, trajectories of the random surrogate model of the likelihood function are drawn and injected in the MCMC algorithm. An application on a train suspension monitoring case is presented.}

abstract = {Abstract The past few decades have witnessed an explosive synergy between physics and the life sciences. In particular, physical modelling in medicine and physiology is a topical research area. The present work focuses on parameter inference and uncertainty quantification in a 1D fluid-dynamics model for quantitative physiology: the pulmonary blood circulation. The practical challenge is the estimation of the patient-specific biophysical model parameters, which cannot be measured directly. In principle this can be achieved based on a comparison between measured and predicted data. However, predicting data requires solving a system of partial differential equations (PDEs), which usually have no closed-form solution, and repeated numerical integrations as part of an adaptive estimation procedure are computationally expensive. In the present article, we demonstrate how fast parameter estimation combined with sound uncertainty quantification can be achieved by a combination of statistical emulation and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling. We compare a range of state-of-the-art MCMC algorithms and emulation strategies, and assess their performance in terms of their accuracy and computational efficiency. The long-term goal is to develop a method for reliable disease prognostication in real time, and our work is an important step towards an automatic clinical decision support system.},

We improve upon previous Bayesian quadrature techniques by explicitly modelling the non-negativity of our integrands, and the correlations that exist between them. It offers most where the integrand is multi-modal and expensive to evaluate, as is commonplace in exoplanets research; we demonstrate the efficacy of our method on data from the Kepler spacecraft.}

abstract = {Abstract Parameters in climate models are usually calibrated manually, exploiting only small subsets of the available data. This precludes both optimal calibration and quantification of uncertainties. Traditional Bayesian calibration methods that allow uncertainty quantification are too expensive for climate models; they are also not robust in the presence of internal climate variability. For example, Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods typically require model runs and are sensitive to internal variability noise, rendering them infeasible for climate models. Here we demonstrate an approach to model calibration and uncertainty quantification that requires only model runs and can accommodate internal climate variability. The approach consists of three stages: (a) a calibration stage uses variants of ensemble Kalman inversion to calibrate a model by minimizing mismatches between model and data statistics; (b) an emulation stage emulates the parameter-to-data map with Gaussian processes (GP), using the model runs in the calibration stage for training; (c) a sampling stage approximates the Bayesian posterior distributions by sampling the GP emulator with MCMC. We demonstrate the feasibility and computational efficiency of this calibrate-emulate-sample (CES) approach in a perfect-model setting. Using an idealized general circulation model, we estimate parameters in a simple convection scheme from synthetic data generated with the model. The CES approach generates probability distributions of the parameters that are good approximations of the Bayesian posteriors, at a fraction of the computational cost usually required to obtain them. Sampling from this approximate posterior allows the generation of climate predictions with quantified parametric uncertainties.},

ABSTRACT = {We present an approach to enhance the performance and flexibility of the Bayesian inference of model parameters based on observations of the measured data. Going beyond the usual surrogate-enhanced Monte-Carlo or optimization methods that focus on a scalar loss, we place emphasis on a function-valued output of a formally infinite dimension. For this purpose, the surrogate models are built on a combination of linear dimensionality reduction in an adaptive basis of principal components and Gaussian process regression for the map between reduced feature spaces. Since the decoded surrogate provides the full model output rather than only the loss, it is re-usable for multiple calibration measurements as well as different loss metrics and, consequently, allows for flexible marginalization over such quantities and applications to Bayesian hierarchical models. We evaluate the method&rsquo;s performance based on a case study of a toy model and a simple riverine diatom model for the Elbe river. As input data, this model uses six tunable scalar parameters as well as silica concentrations in the upper reach of the river together with the continuous time-series of temperature, radiation, and river discharge over a specific year. The output consists of continuous time-series data that are calibrated against corresponding measurements from the Geesthacht Weir station at the Elbe river. For this study, only two scalar inputs were considered together with a function-valued output and compared to an existing model calibration using direct simulation runs without a surrogate.},

abstract = {Abstract Climate projections continue to be marred by large uncertainties, which originate in processes that need to be parameterized, such as clouds, convection, and ecosystems. But rapid progress is now within reach. New computational tools and methods from data assimilation and machine learning make it possible to integrate global observations and local high-resolution simulations in an Earth system model (ESM) that systematically learns from both and quantifies uncertainties. Here we propose a blueprint for such an ESM. We outline how parameterization schemes can learn from global observations and targeted high-resolution simulations, for example, of clouds and convection, through matching low-order statistics between ESMs, observations, and high-resolution simulations. We illustrate learning algorithms for ESMs with a simple dynamical system that shares characteristics of the climate system; and we discuss the opportunities the proposed framework presents and the challenges that remain to realize it.},

The run times of computer-intensive simulators are often such that it is impractical to make the thousands of model runs that are conventionally required for sensitivity analysis, uncertainty analysis or calibration. In response to this problem, highly efficient techniques have recently been developed based on a statistical meta-model (the emulator) that is built to approximate the computer model. The approach, however, is less straightforward for dynamic simulators, designed to represent time-evolving systems. Generalisations of the established methodology to allow for dynamic emulation are here proposed and contrasted. Advantages and difficulties are discussed and illustrated with an application to the Sheffield Dynamic Global Vegetation Model, developed within the UK Centre for Terrestrial Carbon Dynamics.}

Building on the theoretical results of Fedorov (1972, Theory of Optimal Experiments, Academic Press) and MacKay (1992, Neural Computation, 4, 590–604), I apply techniques from optimal experiment design (OED) to guide the query/action selection of a neural network learner. I demonstrate that these techniques allow the learner to minimize its generalization error by exploring its domain efficiently and completely. I conclude that, while not a panacea, OED-based query/action selection has much to offer, especially in domains where its high computational costs can be tolerated.

The model function is assumed to be computationally expensive and therefore is described by a random field (such as a Gaussian process emulator). The sequential design strategy is a greedy one-step look ahead method, minimizing the Bayes risk with respect to a loss function measuring the quadratic \$L^2\$-error in the likelihood estimate. Four numerical examples demonstrate that the proposed sampling method is more efficient than space-filling, prior-based designs. }

Existing techniques for posterior estimation are based on generating samples representative of the posterior. Such methods do not consider efficiency in terms of likelihood evaluations. In order to be query efficient we treat posterior estimation in an active regression framework. We propose two myopic query strategies to choose where to evaluate the likelihood and implement them using Gaussian processes. Via experiments on a series of synthetic and real examples we demonstrate that our approach is significantly more query efficient than existing techniques and other heuristics for posterior estimation.},

abstract = {Many model-based investigation techniques, such as sensitivity analysis, optimization, and statistical inference, require a large number of model evaluations to be performed at different input and/or parameter values. This limits the application of these techniques to models that can be implemented in computationally efficient computer codes. Emulators, by providing efficient interpolation between outputs of deterministic simulation models, can considerably extend the field of applicability of such computationally demanding techniques. So far, the dominant techniques for developing emulators have been priors in the form of Gaussian stochastic processes (GASP) that were conditioned with a design data set of inputs and corresponding model outputs. In the context of dynamic models, this approach has two essential disadvantages: (i) these emulators do not consider our knowledge of the structure of the model, and (ii) they run into numerical difficulties if there are a large number of closely spaced input points as is often the case in the time dimension of dynamic models. To address both of these problems, a new concept of developing emulators for dynamic models is proposed. This concept is based on a prior that combines a simplified linear state space model of the temporal evolution of the dynamic model with Gaussian stochastic processes for the innovation terms as functions of model parameters and/or inputs. These innovation terms are intended to correct the error of the linear model at each output step. Conditioning this prior to the design data set is done by Kalman smoothing. This leads to an efficient emulator that, due to the consideration of our knowledge about dominant mechanisms built into the simulation model, can be expected to outperform purely statistical emulators at least in cases in which the design data set is small. The feasibility and potential difficulties of the proposed approach are demonstrated by the application to a simple hydrological model.}

    abstract = { We develop Bayesian dynamic linear model Gaussian processes for emulation of time series output for computer models that may exhibit chaotic behavior, but where this behavior retains some underlying structure. The statistical technology is particularly suited to emulating the time series output of large climate models that exhibit this feature and where we want samples from the posterior of the emulator to evolve in the same way as dynamic processes in the computer model do. The methodology combines key features of good uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods such as using complex mean functions to capture large-scale signals within parameter space, with dynamic linear models in a way that allows UQ to borrow strength from the Bayesian time series literature. We present an MCMC algorithm for sampling from the posterior of the emulator parameters when the roughness lengths of the Gaussian process are unknown. We discuss an interpretation of the results of this algorithm that allows us to use MCMC to fix the correlation lengths, making future online samples from the emulator tractable when used in practical applications where online MCMC is infeasible. We apply this methodology to emulate the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) as a time series output of the fully coupled non--flux-adjusted atmosphere-ocean general circulation model HadCM3. }

Of particular interest here is the calibration of the parameters of computer models from high-dimensional physical observations. When the run times of these computer codes is high, this work focuses on the numerical challenges associated with the statistical inference. In particular, several adaptations of the Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) to the high-dimensional or functional output case are presented for the emulation of computer codes from limited data. Then, an adaptive procedure is detailed to minimize the calibration parameters uncertainty at the minimal computational cost. The proposed method is eventually applied to two applications that are based on dynamic simulators.}

abstract="The optimization of expensive-to-evaluate functions generally relies on metamodel-based exploration strategies. Many deterministic global optimization algorithms used in the field of computer experiments are based on Kriging (Gaussian process regression). Starting with a spatial predictor including a measure of uncertainty, they proceed by iteratively choosing the point maximizing a criterion which is a compromise between predicted performance and uncertainty. Distributing the evaluation of such numerically expensive objective functions on many processors is an appealing idea. Here we investigate a multi-points optimization criterion, the multipoints expected improvement ({\$}q-{\{}{\backslash}mathbb E{\}}I{\$}), aimed at choosing several points at the same time. An analytical expression of the {\$}q-{\{}{\backslash}mathbb E{\}}I{\$}is given when q{\thinspace}={\thinspace}2, and a consistent statistical estimate is given for the general case. We then propose two classes of heuristic strategies meant to approximately optimize the {\$}q-{\{}{\backslash}mathbb E{\}}I{\$}, and apply them to the classical Branin-Hoo test-case function. It is finally demonstrated within the covered example that the latter strategies perform as good as the best Latin Hypercubes and Uniform Designs ever found by simulation (2000 designs drawn at random for every q{\thinspace}∈ [1,10]).",

abstract = {Computer models simulating a physical process are used in many areas of science. Due to the complex nature of these codes it is often necessary to approximate the code, which is typically done using a Gaussian process. In many situations the number of code runs available to build the Gaussian process approximation is limited. When the initial design is small or the underlying response surface is complicated this can lead to poor approximations of the code output. In order to improve the fit of the model, sequential design strategies must be employed. In this paper we introduce two simple distance based metrics that can be used to augment an initial design in a batch sequential manner. In addition we propose a sequential updating strategy to an orthogonal array based Latin hypercube sample. We show via various real and simulated examples that the distance metrics and the extension of the orthogonal array based Latin hypercubes work well in practice.}

abstract = {Inferring arbitrary quantities of interest (QoI) using limited computational or, in realistic scenarios, financial budgets, is a challenging problem that requires sophisticated strategies for the optimal allocation of the available resources. Bayesian optimal experimental design identifies the optimal set of design locations for the purpose of solving a parameter inference problem and the optimality criterion is typically associated with maximizing the worth of information in the experimental measurements. Sequential design strategies further identify the optimal design in a sequential manner, starting from a initial budget and iteratively selecting new optimal points until either an accuracy threshold is reached, or a cost limit is exceeded. In this paper, we present a generic sequential Bayesian experimental design framework that relies on maximizing an information theoretic design criterion, namely the Expected Information Gain, in order to infer QoIs formed as nonlinear operators acting on black-box functions. Our framework relies on modeling the underlying response function using non-stationary Gaussian Processes, thus enabling efficient sampling from the QoI in order to provide Monte Carlo estimators for the design criterion. We demonstrate the performance of our method on an engineering problem of steel wire manufacturing and compare it with two classic approaches: uncertainty sampling and expected improvement.}
