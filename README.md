# Modular Uncertainty Propagation for Surrogate-Based Bayesian Inverse Problems 

To replicate the environment used to run the experiments:
```bash
uv python pin 3.13.8
uv sync --frozen
```

This will create a virtual environment; all Python code should be run using
this virtual environment, which can be activated using
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```
